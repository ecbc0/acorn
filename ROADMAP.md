# The road to dependent types

## Philosophy on planning itself

There are two big categories of things we need to do. First, we need to make the AI better, and second, the language needs to support all of the mathematics that people want to write. The AI part of things is tough to plan in too much detail, because it's all experimental. We need to try little things and see what works.

Language features are more straightforward to plan. So that's what this roadmap focuses on. And there is one feature that is more requested than anything else: dependent types.

A lot of the groundwork has been laid, like options and uninhabited types. We still have some stuff to do.

### Make constrained types use options instead of forcing inhabitedness

When a type is defined like

```
structure Foo {
    bar: Bar
} constraint {
    qux(bar)
}
```

Currently, we require that `qux` is true for some `bar`. This is because the constructor `Foo.new` always returns a `Foo`, and we need some "default". Instead, we should make `Foo.new` return an `Option`.

### Side quest: generic let-satisfy

It would be great to define methods like:

```
let pick_any[T](list: List[T]) -> item: T satisfy {
    if list.length > 0 {
        list.contains(item)
    }
} by {
  // Proof here
}
```

However, this code is similar to the constructor of a constrained type, in that it lets you introduce terms of type `T` with no precondition, thus implicitly assuming that the type is inhabited. We should just check that `T` is inhabited here before allowing this syntax.

### Side quest: generic instances

Relations like:

```
instance NonZero[F: Field]: Group
```

We are not monomorphizing any more, which makes this more plausible.

### Dependent types frontend

Once the internals support all of the above, it's time to expose dependent types in the frontend in the ways that are useful.

We need to figure out a syntax that can handle things like defining:

```
Fin[k]

Zmod[k]

Vector[Real, k]
```

What else?

## Open Questions

### Question mark syntax.

It seems nice to be able to do

```
let first_plus_last = list.first? + list.last?
```

Here the `?` requires proving that its argument is not none. Like syntactic sugar for

```
let Option.some(first) = list.first
let Option.some(last) = list.last
let first_plus_last = first + last
```

This way you can deal with options that happen inside an expression, not just options that happen inside a statement.

One issue is that the current prover is bad at proving "foo and bar" type goals. The harness could just give the prover one goal at a time when this happens. But we would need to change the interface so that a point in the code could be associated with multiple goals.

Another issue is that syntactically, not every expression can be associated with a proving goal, so this
syntax wouldn't be usable everywhere, which would lead to some confusion.

Another possibility would be to implement a more general solution, a way of expressing when one type could be converted into another type, and treat this as a case of converting an `Option[T]` into a `T`.

Another possibility is to simply punt on implementing this syntax and make the LLMs spell it out.
